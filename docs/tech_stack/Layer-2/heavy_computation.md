# Heavy Computation
Heavy computation protocols and applications provide users with reliable and cheap computation. 

Examples are:

  * Cartesi
  * Golem
  * TrueBit

## Cartesi

Cartesi is a layer-2 platform for the development and deployment of scalable decentralized applications. The DApp logic runs off-chain on a reproducible VM, free from the computational limits and fees of the blockchain, while maintaining its security guarantees. Since their VM is compatible with Linux, developers can build complex decentralized logic using mainstream software stacks and tools.

## Golem
Golem is a global, open source, decentralized supercomputer that anyone can access. It is made up of the combined power of users' machines, from PCs to entire data centers.

## TrueBit
TrueBit gives Ethereum smart contracts a computational boost. Don't let Ethereum's gas limit drag your imagination! A novel incentive structure guarantees fast, reliable, and affordable results without third-party trust.
